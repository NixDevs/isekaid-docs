# Pets
Pets help you in battle against monsters and give you perks when winning a battle. 
Pets have a growth rate, the higher the growth rate, the better the perks, and the better the pet is. 
They may have a variety of perks such as higher damage dealt, hp recovered, higher experience and more!

## Getting Started
Pets are gained through the shop, using `$buy summon`. To level up your pet, you must feed your pet materials which you can view using the `$inv` command. Feed your pet using `$pet feed [pet no.] [material] [amount]`
These materials give your pet experience to increase your pet's level.
Check your pets using `$pets view`.
