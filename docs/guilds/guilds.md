# Guilds
Guilds are a way to play as a team and achieve more perks when winning battles. Levelling up guilds is based on how much gold is donated to the server. Progressively, each level requires more and more gold. Rewards include a higher experience gain rate which can easily boost your levelling rate immensely. Guilds are managed by the **guild owner**, who only has the power to manage the guild. 

## Getting started
Guilds are created using `$guild create [guild-name]`. You then have access to the following commands:
* `$guild invite [mention]` : Invites a player to a guild.
* `$guild kick [mention]` : Removes a player from a guild

!!! danger
    The commands `$guild disband` and `$changeowner` are dangerous to use, and effects may be irreversible!

## Donating
Members can donate gold using `$guild donate [amt]` which can level up the server. Experience boost increases on level up.
