# Equipment
Equipment is a great way to boost your stats. Weapons have different rarities:
* common
* rare
* epic 
* legendary
The higher the rarity the better the base boost stats. View your equipment using `$inv`

## Fusing 
Fusing equipment can join both the equipments' stats to make it better. To fuse, they must be the same rank and name.
The stats that new equipment has is dependent on what stats their previous items do but the numbers themselves are completely random. Fusing costs gold depending on the tier of the fusion. 

The command usage is `$fuse {id1} {id2}`.
## Selling
To sell an item use the `$sell {id}` to get a confirmation message. Make sure you are releasing the correct weapon before confirming.

    Fusing items is irreversible!
