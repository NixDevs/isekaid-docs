# Skills
Skills are moves, at the start you'd be given slash as a skill and that's it. You can learn more skills later on using `$learn` while to check every move you can learn as well as moves in your class/subclass you can use `$skilltree`. Skills can be unlocked by levelling up, and you can learn up to 4 skills. 

View a skill using `$sv {skillname}`. View your skills using `$skills`.
