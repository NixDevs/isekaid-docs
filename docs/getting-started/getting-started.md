# Getting Started!
Type `$start` to pick a race. Races give you different buffs either in battle, after battle, or after levelling up.<br>

| Race        | Description                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Human`     | Additional 10% **experience** whenever you kill an enemy   |
| `Demon`     | Increases strength by 1 **stat point** on level up     |
| `Undead`    | Heals 10% of total health per round during battle      |
| `Elf`       | Increases intelligence by 1 **stat point** on level up |
| `Lizardman` | Increases defense by 1 **stat point** on level up      |

Upon reaching level 10, you obtain access to subclasses. Read about subclasses [here](../subclasses/subclasses.md)

!!! note

    It is important to note that intelligence is used for damage in all mage subclasses and soulthief rogue. Strength is used for other subclasses. Learn about subclasses here

    After you choose an option you cannot choose another race or class unless you type `$restart`, so choose wisely!
